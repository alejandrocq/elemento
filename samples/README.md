# Elemento Samples

This folder contains different [implementations](https://hal.github.io/elemento/index.html) of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application:
 
- GWT: [Source](gwt) | [Demo](https://hal.github.io/elemento/gwt/index.html)
- J2CL: [Source](j2cl) | [Demo](https://hal.github.io/elemento/j2cl/index.html)

All samples use the same key to persist the todo items in the local storage. So you can switch between the samples and continue working on your tasks seamlessly ;-)
