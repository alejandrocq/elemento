# Elemento Samples

This folder contains different [implementations](https://hal.github.io/elemento/index.html) of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application. Each sample uses Elemento and is based either on GWT or J2CL: 
 
- [GWT](https://hal.github.io/elemento/gwt/index.html): Pure Elemento based on GWT
- [J2CL](https://hal.github.io/elemento/j2cl/index.html) Pure Elemento based on J2CL
- [Crysknife](https://hal.github.io/elemento/crysknife/index.html): Elemento, Crysknife CDI, Crysknife templates based on J2CL

All samples use the same key to persist the todo items in the local storage. So you can switch between the samples and continue working on your tasks seamlessly ;-)
